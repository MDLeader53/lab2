  ## Outline
  
  - Pair up and find your team member
- Create a repository (one per team) & give access to your teammate
- Do a data exploration (on chocolate ratings)
- Create R markdown files that contain code to answer the questions and create the plots
- Submit!
  
  
  
  ## Background
  
  Brady Brelinski, Founding Member of the Manhattan Chocolate Society, obviously likes chocolate. He has assembled a database of ratings for plain dark chocolate bars: [Flavors of chocolate](http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html)

By now, over 1900 different chocolate bars have been rated. 

## Meaning of ratings

Flavors of Cacao Rating System:
  
- 5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
- 4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
- 3= Satisfactory (3.0) to praiseworthy (3.75) (well made with special qualities)
- 2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
- 1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)


## Question set (individual)

Coordinate with your teammate and decide among you who is Individual 1 and Individual 2, respectively. Each of you should create an RMarkdown file either named `individual1.Rmd` or `individual2.Rmd` to include the answers.

**For each of the questions below provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.**
  
  1. How are ratings distributed? Don't forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
  2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 
  3. What class is the variable representing company locations? How is this different from a 'character' variable? (You do not need to produce a graphic for this question.)
