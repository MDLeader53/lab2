## question 1

```{r, eval=TRUE}
recent_rating = choco[choco$Review.Date>2011,]
# creates recent_rating varable that contains choco review data for all years greater than 2011
unique(recent_rating$Company.Location) # NOTICE: how many countries are listed but how many levels are there? 
# find all the uniqe country locations in recent rating data set- removed any lines of data that had duplate contries 
recent_rating$Company.Location = droplevels(recent_rating$Company.Location)
# removes the empty levels created by the unique methiod call
head(recent_rating)

#defines the plot legend
```

## question 2
2 \. Click Zoom on the Rstudio window (under Plots) to see the plot more clearly. How do you think the plot produced from the code above can be improved? Recommend at least one possible improvement. 
instead of having the review be eather high or low use a gradeant color scale to show there values or use a 3rd color thats  an ok review. or use  a histagram with the years on the x axes the coco on y-axes and each bucket is a review for that year (grouped by years) and above each bar is the rating
