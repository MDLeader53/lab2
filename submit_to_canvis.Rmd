2 \. Click Zoom on the Rstudio window (under Plots) to see the plot more clearly. How do you think the plot produced from the code above can be improved? Recommend at least one possible improvement. 
instead of having the review be eather high or low use a gradeant color scale to show there values or use a 3rd color thats  an ok review. or use  a histagram with the years on the x axes the coco on y-axes and each bucket is a review for that year (grouped by years) and above each bar is the rating

## Question set (individual1)

Coordinate with your teammate and decide among you who is Individual 1 and Individual 2, respectively. Each of you should create an RMarkdown file either named `individual1.Rmd` or `individual2.Rmd` to include the answers.

**For each of the questions below provide at least one graphic as a basis for your answer.**
  
  1. How are ratings distributed? Dont forget to mention outliers, if there are any.
    ```{r,eval=TRUE}
plot(choco$Rating,choco$Cocoa.Pct, xlab = "Ratings", ylab = "Cocoa Percentage", pch = 2, cex=2) # creates a plot with Ratings on x-axis and Cocoa Percentage of y-axis. The symbol of points is set to be a triangle (pch=2) and the size of the points is adjusted to be larger (cex=2). 
```
  - the rating are distributed heavaly in the center between 2 and 4 with and looks to be -right scude 
  -  there looks like there could be one outlire at 5  
  
  2. Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar? 
    ```{r,eval=TRUE}
plot(choco$Rating,choco$Cocoa.Pct, xlab = "Ratings", ylab = "Cocoa Percentage", pch = 2, cex=2) # creates a plot with Ratings on x-axis and Cocoa Percentage of y-axis. The symbol of points is set to be a triangle (pch=2) and the size of the points is adjusted to be larger (cex=2). 
```
  -  yes there is vary little rating with 50% coco and while most of the rating have around -70% coc those that have 100% have alower than avrage rating compared to the whole group
  
  3. What class is the variable representing company locations? How is this different from a -'character' variable? (You do not need to produce a graphic for this question.)
  - its class is factor
